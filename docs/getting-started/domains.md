title: Domains & SSL

Each app has its own unique URL based on its name. For example, if your app is called `demo`, then the URL for the app will be `demo.unubo.app`. 

## Custom domains
In order to use a custom domain, follow the instructions in the `Domains` section of your app.
These steps may vary depending on the type of application.

## SSL certificates (https)
Unubo can automatically create and manage your app's SSL certificate for free. Simply check the box next to `Free SSL certificate`.
<br/><br/>
If your DNS manager already provides an SSL certificate (e.g. Cloudflare), uncheck the box.
