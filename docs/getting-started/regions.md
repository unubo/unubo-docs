Unubo applications can be deployed to various regions. You specify your region when you first create your app.

## Available regions

| Region ID | Name          | Location               |
| --------- | ------------- | ---------------------- |
| asia      | Asia          | Singapore              |
| europe    | Europe        | London, United Kingdom |
| us        | United States | Oregon, United States  |

More regions will be added in future based on demand.

## Why different regions?

You can deploy your apps to a region that is closest to your desired users in order to provide a faster service.
<br/>
Let's say your target users are based the United Kingdom. If your application is deployed to the United States, 
it will take longer for your app to respond to a user's requests. This is called latency.
<br/><br/>
By locating the app close to your inteded users, means that the distance that data travels between your app and 
the user is greatly reduced.

Check the [Status monitor](status-monitor.md) section to understand how your app responds from different locations around the world.
