title: Status Monitor
---

Unubo applications now come with their own status monitor. Unubo checks to see the status of your app from various locations around the world.

## Health checks
Unubo regularly checks the status of your app to make sure it is still running and healthy. The `Monitor` section of your app defines the path for Unubo to check (i.e. `/status` or `/health`).
<br/><br/>
This must be a valid path for your app, otherwise your app will not run on Unubo.
