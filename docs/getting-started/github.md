In order to deploy your application to Unubo, you'll need to grant access to your GitHub repository.
<br/>
Support for GitLab and Bitbucket is coming soon.

## Grant access
<ol>
  <li>Go to the <a href="https://unubo.app/services" target="_blank">Services</a> page.</li>
  <li>Select the "Connect" button.</li>
  <li>Choose your account.</li>
  <li>Select all or individual repos.</li>
</ol>

You're now ready to deploy code from your GitHub repos.

## Update access
You can also update which repos Unubo has access to.
<ol>
  <li>Go to the <a href="https://unubo.app/services" target="_blank">Services</a> page.</li>
  <li>Select the "Manage access" link.</li>
</ol>

From there you will be able to configure which repos Unubo can access.
